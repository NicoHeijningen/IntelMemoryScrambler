IntelMemoryScrambler


The work accompanying this code is named "Professionalizing hardware-based memory acquisition for incident response scenarios: Cold boot using Coreboot and the Intel memory scrambler". 

The Coreboot source code to profile the memory scrambler can be found at https://review.coreboot.org/#/c/18539/.

The files prepended with 0-3 allow all possible PRBSes to be generated by running them in order. The data generated is saved in the respective directory in the "output" folder. "deletealloutput.py" removes all output but leaves the required directory-tree intact. "prettyprint.py" prints the first 64 bytes of an input file in the 'keyblock' format.

This work was based of that of Bauer, Gruhn, and Freiling: "Lest we forget: Cold-boot attacks on scrambled DDR3 memory ". Part of their source code is used and all credits for this go to them.
